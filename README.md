# ORGANIZING YOUR JAVASCRIPT CODE | TodoList Project

## Assignment Git Workflow

- Step one: after git pull upstream the repo
- Step two: git add / git commit / git push
- step three: Create a pull request to your branch

! IMPORTANT: You will need to create a Pull Request merging back into your own branch name and NOT the main repository (SocialHackersAcademy).

#### INSTRUCTIONS

1.  Create a new HTML file
2.  Create a new js file, and link it to your HTML.
3.  Create a new css file,also link it to your HTML.

#### **What do you think if we start with adding some new HTML elements,to see something on the screen:**

4.**In your HTML**:

- Create a container div for our app. We will put all our elements inside this container and this container will be the parent of our app.
  give this container a class name of `container`.
- Create an `<h2>` element with a "TO-DO App" as its content.
- Create a new `<div>` and give it an `id = "input-container"`, within your div:

  - Add an input text field,with an `id = inputTask`
  - Add an Add button with an `id = addTask `.

- Create another new div and give it an `id = "lists-container"`",
  (do not add any task manually,let javaScript do that for you).
  - create an empty unordered list `<ol>` and give it an `id=“todo-list”`.

5. For now you do not have to worry about styling your project.

6. **In your js file**:

Your 'todos' are going to be an array of objects that you'll want to dynamically create, which means either using factories or constructors/classes to generate them.

**How to start??**

Once a new task is added, we’ll create a new todo object, push it into the array and render the value of the text property on the screen.

- The first thing we need to do is to create an array where we’ll place the todo list items.

- Each todo item will be an object with three properties: `text`, a string which holds whatever the user types into the text input, `checked`, a boolean which helps us know if a task has been marked completed or not, and `id`, a unique identifier for the item

- create a function (factory function) called addTodo that will :
  create the toDo object, and push this toDo in our todoItems array.

Note:

the text value will be passed as a parameter. while `checked` should be `false` by default, and `id` should be any unique value (see `Date.now()`).

- console.log your todoItems array.

- **Now we will add the task**:

  Let’s start by adding a todo item to our list. To do so, we need to listen for the click event on the Add button element, and then invoke a new `addTodo()` function when the button is clicked.

- Add a click event-listener to your button, when the button is clicked.
- Take the task text from the input field.
- check if the task is empty or not.
- If it is empty then alert the user ("Please add something).
- if not, add the task object in the todoItems array
  **Hint**: you can do this by calling the addTod function.
- Clear the value of the text input after adding the task.
  (think what value should be added to clear it)
- focus the text field so that the user can add multiple items to the list without having to focus the input over and over again.
  **Hint:** search about Input Text focus() Method,to know what is it.

Finally, the task is pushed to the todoItems array, and the array is logged to the console.

---

**Render the todo items**:

Once a new todo item is added to the todoItems array, we want the app to be updated with the item rendered on the screen.

to do that:

- create a function called renderToDo,that take the text as a parameter.
- Create a new task (HTML element) <li> element, that contains the entered text.
  Hint: use createElement method
- Add the task to the unordered list.
  Hint: you can use the appendChild method.
- add the renderTodo() function above addTodo(),and call it in the addTodo().
- finally invoke(call) your renderTodo function in the addTodo function,so it will be invoked each time a new todo item is added.

---

**Remove the last added todo items**:

- Using javascript create a button called remove in the first `input-container` div.
- Add a click event listener to the button.
- Remove the last added Todo when you click the button.
- Do not forget to check if we have tasks or not, and alert the user if we do not.

---

**In your css file**:

- Do some styling to your app and make it prettier.

---

```
Congratulations:
Now you build Todo App that can add and remove tasks.

```

### Extra credit:

Let’s add more features to our app:

- When you add a task, add a checkbox in front of each one.
- Add an event-listener on your checkbox that will mark your task as completed(strikethrough task) when checked.
- Add a remove button for each task.
- Add an event listener on this button that will remove that task when clicked and update the DOM.
- Create a new button that will remove the completed tasks only whenever the button is clicked.
- Try to figure out a way to edit the tasks, it's up to you how to do so.
